              I am a policymaker/researcher. How can I use STARA?
            </h3>
            <p>
              STARA is currently available in closed beta, and we&rsquo;rre excited to put the system in the hands of policymakers and researchers.
              If you&rsquo;re interested in using STARA, please feel free to reach out to us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reglab [at] law [dot] stanford [dot] edu</span>. We are not able to respond to all inbounds, but it is particularly helpful if you can let us know who you are, what jurisdiction you&rsquo;re interested in, and what kind of reform/research effort you&rsquo;d like to undertake.

              What jurisdictions does STARA cover?
            </h3>
            <p>
              STARA&rsquo;s architecture is designed to be jurisdiction-agnostic. The system currently supports the United States Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, San Francisco&rsquo;s Municipal Code, and the statutory codes of all 50 states. Other legal codes can be added to STARA where there exists well-structured markup such as XML or HTML.

              What makes STARA more effective than general purpose systems like ChatGPT?
            </h3>
            <p>
              STARA builds on the same underlying large language models used by services like ChatGPT! However, by default, these systems perform poorly on complex statutory research tasks for a few reasons:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Unusual and diffuse statutory language:</strong> Statutory provisions have little in common with traditional prose. They contain highly precise language, terminology that may be defined in distant sections, and a web of non-obvious interdependencies. In many cases,
                  individual subsections are nothing more than sentence fragments, understandable only with reference to language contained in a parent provision. Via its preprocessing pipeline, STARA supplies LLMs with the nonlocal context necessary—definitions, cross-references, headings, etc.—to make sense of provisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lack of systematicity:</strong> Most AI research systems are meant to gather some number of relevant documents and then summarize them. But STARA is meant for systematic research, where one must locate <em>all</em> statutory language meeting some criteria. It therefore takes a fundamentally different approach from other research systems—batch annotation followed by aggregation, rather than a single thread of research.
                </li>
              </ul>
              We show that STARA&rsquo;s approach far outperforms general purpose architectures on a variety of statutory survey tasks:
