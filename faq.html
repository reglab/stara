              I am a policymaker/researcher. How can I use STARA?
            </h3>
            <p>
              STARA is currently available in closed beta, and we&rsquo;re excited to put the system in the hands of policymakers and researchers.
              If you&rsquo;re interested in using STARA, please feel free to reach out to us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reglab [at] law [dot] stanford [dot] edu</span>. We are not able to respond to all inbounds, but it is particularly helpful if you can let us know who you are, what jurisdiction you&rsquo;re interested in, and what kind of reform/research effort you&rsquo;d like to undertake.

              What jurisdictions does STARA cover?
            </h3>
            <p>
              STARA&rsquo;s architecture is designed to be jurisdiction-agnostic. The system currently supports the United States Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, San Francisco&rsquo;s Municipal Code, and the statutory codes of all 50 states. Other legal codes can be added to STARA where there exists well-structured markup such as XML or HTML.

              What makes STARA more effective than general purpose systems like ChatGPT?
            </h3>
            <p>
              STARA builds on the same underlying large language models used by services like ChatGPT! However, by default, these systems perform poorly on complex statutory research tasks for a few reasons:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Unusual and diffuse statutory language:</strong> Statutory provisions have little in common with traditional prose. They contain highly precise language, terminology that may be defined in distant sections, and a web of non-obvious interdependencies. In many cases,
                  individual subsections are nothing more than sentence fragments, understandable only with reference to language contained in a parent provision. Via its preprocessing pipeline, STARA supplies LLMs with the nonlocal context necessary—definitions, cross-references, headings, etc.—to make sense of provisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lack of systematicity:</strong> Most AI research systems are meant to gather some number of relevant documents and then summarize them. But STARA is meant for systematic research, where one must locate <em>all</em> statutory language meeting some criteria. It therefore takes a fundamentally different approach from other research systems—batch annotation followed by aggregation, rather than a single thread of research.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Through a series of <a href="/">ablation studies</a>, we show that STARA&rsquo;s approach far outperforms general purpose architectures on a variety of statutory survey tasks. We also benchmark STARA against the Deep Research products offered by OpenAI and Google, and show that STARA locates as many as 30 times more provisions than the best-performing Deep Research product on some statutory survey tasks.
