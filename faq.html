            <h3 class="title is-4">What are racially restrictive covenants?</h3>
            <p>
              Racially restrictive covenants are discriminatory clauses that
              prohibited the purchase, lease, or occupation of land based on
              race. Racial covenants originated in the mid-19th century, but
              became more prevalent after the Supreme Court held racial zoning
              unconstitutional in Buchanan v. Warley (1917). Instead, homeowners
              turned to private transactions and racial covenants as a way to
              protect property values and maintain racial homogeneity within
              their communities. Although declared unenforceable by the United
              States Supreme Court in Shelley v. Kraemer (1948) and illegal
              under the Fair Housing Act (1968), such covenants continue to
              exist in the pages of real property records across the nation.

            <h3 class="title is-4">What is California's AB 1466?</h3>
            <p>
              California enacted legislation in 2021 (<a
                href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1466"

                >AB 1466</a
              >) that mandates that counties redact racially restrictive deed
              covenants. Each county must develop an implementation plan to
              identify and redact such records. For a county like Santa Clara,
              this involves a substantial effort to potentially examine 24
              million deed documents, spanning 84 million pages, dating back to
              the 1850s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to AB 1466, individual homeowners could petition for legal
              review of covenants, but as in other jurisdictions putting the
              onus on homeowners, few individuals did so.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other areas, groups have crowdsourced the identification of
              racial covenants, with thousands of volunteers reading over deed
              records (see
              <a

                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >National Covenants Research Coalition</a
              >). Such initiatives are great for involving community members,
              but infeasible in jurisdictions lacking that kind of volunteer
              base.

              collaborated to explore the use of machine learning to solve this
              challenging search task. RegLab amassed a training dataset drawn
              from eight counties across the United States, developed and
              fine-tuned a large language model to detect racial covenants, and
              created a registry to map these covenants in the county. The
              collaboration saved some 86,500 person hours that would have been
              required for manual review of records and the model will be made
              available for free for any jurisdiction and research team to use.

              With 57 other counties in California working on the implementation
              of AB 1466 and some dozen states enacting reform around racial
              covenants, the model can dramatically lower the cost of
              identifying such provisions.

              Why does identifying racial covenants matter?
            </h3>
            <p>
              California mandated this kind of review because of the significant
              stigmatic harm that can come from racial covenants in the public
              record, a large number of which employ racial epithets. Professors
              Richard Brooks and Carol Rose also argue in a leading
              <a
                href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674072541"

                >book</a
              >
              that the effect of racial covenants persists due to what they
              signal. In 2002, for instance, a man in Richmond VA refused to
              sell his home to an African American woman, pointing to the racial
              covenant. Even if unenforceable, those words can serve as a signal
              of the type of community.
            </p>
            <p>
              A historical accounting also informs prospective efforts at fair
              housing. The study shows that just a small number of developers
              were responsible for close to a third of racial covenants. Joseph
              Eichler, who famously built ~2700 homes in Palo Alto, however,
              firmly resisted such covenants, and this shows the power of a
              small number of actors in influencing integration and fair
              housing.

              What other areas of legal reform are like this?

            <p>
              The study demonstrates the power of language models to assist in
              legal reform. Reform efforts often run into the complexity of
              language littered across codes, regulations, and records. The
              project demonstrates a path to using technology to aid in such
              efforts. To provide an example other than racial covenants,
              consider
              <a
                href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2014/05/03/unrequired-reading/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1"

                >Congressionally mandated reports</a
              >
              that agencies have to complete. The number has ballooned over
              time, but it&#39;s difficult to count such reports across U.S.
              Code, let alone determine which ones are ripe for sunsetting. The
              power of language models can help identify, catalog, and
              streamline otherwise opaque requirements that can waste government
              resources. As the team demonstrated with racial covenants, this
              can be done with rigorous evaluation, testing, adaptation and
              legal oversight.

We are not able to respond to all inbounds, but it is particularly helpful if you can let us know who you are, what jurisdiction you are interested in, and what deed record data is available.

              We've also made available our trained model for racial covenant detection on <a href="https://huggingface.co/reglab-rrc/mistral-rrc">HuggingFace</a>.
